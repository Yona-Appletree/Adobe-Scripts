Adobe-Scripts
=============

Collection of scripts for Adobe apps, Illustrator mostly

**paths_to_scad.jsx**
- Select a path & run script.
- Currently only works with a single compound path (path with "holes").
- Converts points (what Illustrator uses as a default unit) to millimeters. Design in millimeters and it'll work as expected.
- You'll want to move a point on the path to 0,0 on the artboard to get a decent reference point.
- I've rounded numbers to 1 significant digit to keep my files cleaner.
