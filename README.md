Adobe-Scripts
=============

Collection of scripts for Adobe apps, Illustrator mostly

**even_odd_images-folder.jsx**
*takes a folder of images (gif, jpg, png) and checks to see if width & height are even numbers. If not, it will add or crop a pixel (your choice). Useful for retina-fying images to display clearly as width: 50%*
- Run script from Photoshop
- choose crop or add, the anchor point corner, and a folder of images.

**even_odd_images-action.jsx**
*same as above but use this one within an action to apply on a per image basis (or within your own batch processes)*

**exchange_fill_and_stroke.jsx**
- Select path(s) & run script.

**faux_3d.jsx**
- Select path(s) & run script. *no groups or compound paths*

**paths_to_canvas_beziers.jsx**
**paths_to_canvas_beziers_variables.jsx**
- Move path(s) to 0,0 on the artboard to get a decent reference point.
- Select path(s) & run script. *grouped paths don't work yet*
These both take a path from Illustrator and output it to canvas bezier, with one creating variable arrays of all the points first.

**paths_to_scad.jsx**
*you'll likely want to 'Add Anchor Points' (maybe more than once) then 'Simplify Path' with straight lines, as beziers are not allowed.*

- Select path(s) & run script. *grouped paths don't work yet*
- I've rounded numbers to 2 significant digit to keep my files cleaner.
- Converts points (what Illustrator uses as a default unit) to millimeters.

**random_color-full_featured.jsx**

- You have a variety of options for randomization

**random_rects.jsx**

**rotate_each.jsx**
*a little more control over rotating each path vs. built-in "Transform Each" function*

- Choose 'random' or 'linear' method.
- Input minimum & maximum rotation limits.

**scale_each.jsx**
