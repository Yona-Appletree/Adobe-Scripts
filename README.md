Adobe-Scripts
=============

Collection of scripts for Adobe apps, Illustrator mostly

**paths_to_scad.jsx**
- Select a path & run script.
	- *you'll want to 'Add Anchor Points' (maybe more than once) then 'Simplify Path' with straight lines, as beziers are not allowed.*
- Converts points (what Illustrator uses as a default unit) to millimeters. Design in millimeters and it'll work as expected.
- You'll want to move a point on the path to 0,0 on the artboard to get a decent reference point.
- I've rounded numbers to 2 significant digit to keep my files cleaner.
