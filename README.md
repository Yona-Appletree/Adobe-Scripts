Adobe-Scripts
=============

Collection of scripts for Adobe apps, Illustrator mostly

*paths_to_scad.jsx*
- Select a path & run script.
- Currently only works with a single compound path (path with "holes").
- Converts points (what Illustrator uses as a default unit) to millimeters. Design in millimeters and it'll work as expected.
